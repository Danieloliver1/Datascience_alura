Isso pode acontecer quando ele contém caracteres especiais que não são reconhecidos pela biblioteca Pandas ou quando foi salvo em um formato de codificação diferente do esperado.\n","\n","Para resolver esse erro, é necessário identificar a codificação correta do arquivo CSV e especificá-la ao carregar o arquivo com a biblioteca Pandas. Essa codificação padrão é o UTF-8, mas em alguns casos, o arquivo pode ter sido salvo com uma codificação diferente, como ISO-8859-1.\n","\n","O UTF-8 é uma codificação de caracteres universal usada para representar caracteres de diferentes idiomas de forma compatível com a internet e com sistemas de computador em geral. A sigla UTF significa Unicode Transformation Format (Formato de Transformação Unicode) e o número 8 indica que essa codificação associa uma sequência de 1 a 4 bytes (8 a 32 bits) com cada caractere.\n","\n","A codificação UTF-8 é amplamente utilizada na internet e em sistemas de computador em todo o mundo, pois permite a representação de caracteres de diferentes idiomas em um único conjunto de caracteres. Além disso, essa codificação é capaz de preservar a compatibilidade com outras mais antigas, como ASCII, o que a torna uma escolha popular para a criação e compartilhamento de arquivos de texto.\n","\n","Pode ser que você esteja pensando neste momento: como será que a Giovanna conseguiu descobrir qual é a codificação do arquivo que ela está tentando ler?\n","\n","Existem algumas formas para descobrir isso, no entanto, teremos a oportunidade de experimentar uma maneira prática de fazer isso no próprio Google Colab. Vamos lá?\n","\n","Nós podemos usar uma biblioteca chamada chardet para detectar o encoding de um arquivo CSV. Para utilizar essa biblioteca no Google Colab, basta realizar sua importação:\n","\n","import chardetCOPIAR CÓDIGO\n","Em seguida, digitamos o seguinte bloco de código:\n","\n","with open('/content/dados.csv', 'rb') as file:\n","    print(chardet.detect(file.read()))COPIAR CÓDIGO\n","Note que a primeira linha deste código abre o arquivo CSV em modo de leitura binária rb e atribui o objeto de arquivo retornado a uma variável chamada file.\n","\n","Na segunda linha do código, o conteúdo do arquivo CSV é lido usando o método read() e o resultado é passado para a função chardet.detect(), que retorna um dicionário contendo informações sobre a codificação mais provável do arquivo. O resultado é impresso com a função print() que mostra a codificação e a confiança associada a essa codificação.\n","\n","Ao executar o código Giovanna obteve o seguinte resultado:\n","\n","{'encoding': 'ISO-8859-1', 'confidence': 0.73, 'language': ''}COPIAR CÓDIGO\n","Agora ela sabe que o arquivo CSV provavelmente possui a codificação ISO-8859-1 com uma confiança de 0.73. Para especificar a codificação correta ao carregar o arquivo CSV com a biblioteca Pandas, é possível usar um parâmetro chamado encoding:\n","\n","df = pd.read_csv('/content/dados.csv', encoding='ISO-8859-1')COPIAR CÓDIGO\n","Desta forma, a biblioteca Pandas irá carregar o arquivo CSV usando a codificação ISO-8859-1, o que vai resolver o erro de encoding.
